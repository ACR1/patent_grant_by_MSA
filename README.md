## What else is here?
You'll find a hodgepodge of R scripts for grabbing and extracting a few variables from bulk USPTO biblographic data. These are not particuarly robust and tailored to extract only variables I needed from year 2005 forward.

A few crosswalk files uses to create the match between the USPTO files and Colorado counties.

The Rmarkdown file and associated data pieces are also here.
